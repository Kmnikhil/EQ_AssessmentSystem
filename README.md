## EQ Assessment System

### Overview
The Advanced Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Assessment System is an interactive tool designed to 
evaluate users' emotional intelligence based on their responses to realistic, profession-specific 
scenarios. It leverages transformer-based natural language processing models to analyze 
sentiment and emotions within user responses and provides personalized EQ scores with 
detailed category breakdown. 
This system is implemented as a Django-based web application supporting dynamic question 
generation, response validation, emotional analysis, and visually rich result presentation.
